## next
  - `hspec-discover`: Emit a warning if module name does not match file name
    and `--module-name` is not explicitly specified.  This will allow us in the
    future to derive the module name from the file name in cases where
    --module-name is not specified.

## Changes in 1.12.1
  - Add `--module-name` flag to `hspec-discover` (see #168)

## Changes in 1.12.0
  - Add optional source location to spec items
  - Move item requirement text from `SpecItem` constructor `Item` data type
  - Remove `BuildSpecs` constructor from `SpecTree`, having `runIO` this is not
    really needed
  - Add `mapSpecTree` to `Test.Hspec.Core`
  - Add `afterAll` (see #188)
  - Do not return `Result` from `hspecWith` and accept command-line arguments
    (the old behavior is still available as `hspecWithResult`)
  - Rename `configHandle` to `configOutputFile`
  - Omit empty `describe` groups from report
  - Do not pass position to `Formatter.exampleGroupStarted` (we can not support
    this with the upcomming cleanup actions #188)
  - Do not print empty lines before/after spec groups
  - Deprecate `Test.Hspec.Formatters.newParagraph`

## Changes in 1.11.4

## Changes in 1.10.0
 - Do not use exception type to distinguish between synchronous/asynchronous
   exceptions (thanks to Michael Snoyman)
 - Remove `Example` instance for `Test.HUnit.Test` (#101), use
   `Test.Hspec.HUnit.fromHUnitTest` instead.

   `--print-cpu-time`.

## Changes in 1.4.0
 - We now have a manual at http://hspec.github.io/.  The sources are in
   `doc/`.  It's still work in progress.  Contributions are very welcome!
 - The Haddock documentation now indicates the stability of each exposed
   module.  `Test.Hspec` is now considered stable.
 - `hspec` now supports command-line options
   - `--color` can be used to enable/disable colored output
   - `--format` can be used to pick a specific formatter
   - `--html` can be used to produce an HTML report
   - `--maximum-generated-tests` can be used to specify QuickCheck's
     `maxSuccess`
   - `--match` only runs spec items that match a given string
   - `--re-run` only runs spec items that previously failed.  This is
     undocumented,
     experimental and only works within GHCi (use `:reload` / `:main`)!
 - Runner functions exported from `Test.Hspec.Runner` new expect a monadic
   spec.
 - `fromHUnitTest` has been added.  It can be used to run existing HUnit test
   suites with Hspec.
 - The `Example` instance for HUnit `Test`s has been deprecated.
   `fromHUnitTest` can be used instead.  The primary motivation is, that
   `fromHUnitTest` gives more detailed reporting for nested HUnit test suites.
 - `Test.Hspec.Monadic` has been deprecated, all functionality is available
   through one of `Test.Hspec`, `Test.Hspec.Core` or `Test.Hspec.Runner`.
 - More of Hspec's internals are now exposed from `Test.Hspec.Core`
 - All runner functions for the core spec type (aka as non-monadic spec) have
   been deprecated, use e.g. `Test.Hspec.hspec . fromSpecList` instead.  The
   motivation is to provide an API that does not expose colliding names.
 - Some other stuff from `Test.Hspec.Core` that collides with other parts of
   the API has been deprecated.  Compatible alternatives are given in each
   deprecation message.
 - The default formatter now produces less whitespace (#73) + other minor
   improvements
 - The formatter API has been revamped.
 - The exception type is now printed if an example fails due to an exception
   (#50)
 - The number of pending examples is now printed after each test run (#85)
 - `--verbose` has been added (#87)

## Changes in 1.3.0

 - `Test.Hspec` now re-exports the monadic API.  If you still use the
   non-monadic API, you can use `Test.Hspec.Core` as a drop-in replacement.

 - `hspec-expectations`, a set of combinators that allow to express
   expectations about the outcome of code examples, is now included with Hspec.
   Have a look at the [README of `hspec-expectations`]
   (https://github.com/sol/hspec-expectations#readme)
   for a short introduction.

 - `hspec-discover`, a mechanism for automatic spec discovery, is now an
   official part of Hspec.
   Have a look at [`hspec-discover`'s README]
   (https://github.com/hspec/hspec/tree/master/hspec-discover#readme)
   for a short introduction.

## Changes in 1.2.0

 - `hspec` has been removed, and `hspecX` has been renamed to `hspec` (see
   [#71](https://github.com/hspec/hspec/issues/71))

 - `hHspec` now returns a summary of the test run.

 - The time reporting after a test run is not colored anymore.

## Changes in 1.1.3

 - `Test.Hspec` warns now about future changes: It will re-export
   `Test.Hspec.Monadic` in the future.  If you still use the non-monadic API,
   you can either use `Test.Hspec.Core` as a drop-in replacement, or migrate your
   code to the monadic API.

   The monadic API is more stable and easier to use.  Now is a good time to
   switch!

 - `Test.Hspec.Core` is now a proper superset of `Test.Hspec`

## Changes in 1.1.2

 * All descriptions of nested examples are now included in summary for failing
   examples

 * `context` is now an alias for `describe`

## Changes in 1.1.1

 * Specs from Test.Hspec.Monadic has been renamed to Spec.  For backward
   compatibility Specs is still kept as an alias.

## Changes in 1.1.0

### The reason for pending examples is now optional

With this change, both of the following code snippets work.

```haskell
it "some behavior" $
  pending  -- no reason given
```

```haskell
it "some other behavior" $
  pending "some reason"
```

### Hspec does not rely on ExistentialQuantification anymore

### The type used to represent specs is now abstract

This should give more useful error messages when adapting old specs that use
the non-monadic API for `hspec-1.0`/`hspec-1.1`.

### Several internal types and functions have been deprecated

Those are internal functions, and they will be removed/hidden with the next
release.  If you use any of those, update your code.  If you really need them,
[open a ticket](https://github.com/hspec/hspec/issues) and describe your use
case.

## Changes in 1.0.0

### Hspec now re-uses QuickCheck's property function

`Test.Hspec.QuickCheck.property` is now simply a re-exports of
`Test.QuickCheck.property`.  This has the advantage that you do not get a name
collision if you import both, `Test.Hspec.QuickCheck` and `Test.QuickCheck`.

### Better support for nested specs

*NOTE: This is a breaking change to the non-monadic API.  The monadic API is
not affected.*

In some situations parent descriptions for nested specs were not included in
the generated report.  Solving this required a change to the data structure
that is used to represent specs (it was not a proper tree, now it is).

#### Updating specs that use the non-monadic API

The runner functions (`hspec`, `hspecB` and `hspecX`) now take a list of
descriptions.

The following works with `hspec-0.9`, but not with `hspec-1.0`.

```haskell
main = hspecX $
  describe "reverse" [
    it "reverses a list" $
      reverse [1, 2, 3] == [3, 2, 1],

    it "gives the original list, if applied twice" $ property $
      \xs -> reverse (reverse xs) == (xs :: [Int])
  ]

```

For `hspec-1.0`, you need to wrap it into a list.

```haskell
main = hspecX [
    describe "reverse" [
      it "reverses a list" $
        reverse [1, 2, 3] == [3, 2, 1],

      it "gives the original list, if applied twice" $ property $
        \xs -> reverse (reverse xs) == (xs :: [Int])
    ]
  ]
```

Specs consisting of several *desribes*, combined with `descriptions`, continue
to work unchanged.  But `descriptions` is now a noop, and it will be removed in
a future release.  So it is a good idea to drop it.

The following works with both `hspec-0.9` and `hspec-1.0`.

```haskell
main = hspecX $ descriptions [  -- descriptions is redundant
    describe "Foo" [
      it "has some behavior" True
    ]
  , describe "Bar" [
      it "has some behavior" True
    ]
  ]
```

But the following is recommended instead.

```haskell
main = hspecX [
    describe "Foo" [
      it "has some behavior" True
    ]
  , describe "Bar" [
      it "has some behavior" True
    ]
  ]
```

### A new monadic API for custom Formatters

For all the details, have a look at the [docs]
(http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/hspec/latest/doc/html/Test-Hspec-Formatters.html).


### The total time required to run a spec is now included in the summary

In addition to the used CPU time, the total time required to run a spec is now
include in the summary.  This is useful for specs that do non-CPU-intensive
stuff, or fork subprocesses.
